			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi there! My name is Spencer and I am a computer science student with a passion for software development. With over 9 years of experience working for the navy as an aircrew payload operator, I have gained extensive knowledge in unmanned aircraft technology. My decision to start school 4 years ago was driven by my desire to broaden my skills and opportunities as I transition out of the navy. My long-term goal is to play a role in designing software for these unmanned aircraft platforms. As an avid operator for almost a decade, I have a strong appreciation for the intersection of technology and aviation. Welcome to my computer science portfolio website!.</p>
